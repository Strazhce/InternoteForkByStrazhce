    <h1>Some Basics</h1>
    
    <p>References to global variables are avoided throughout the program except during initialisation.
       The reason for this is that Firefox has a habit of being unable to find your global variables
       all the sudden.  This seems to be some sort of unidentified unreproducable bug to do with using
       a JS code module.  As a result:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All classes are linked together during initialisation by placing references inside the
	    classes - this.utils, this.prefs, etc.  These are also shorter than the real thing.</li>
	<li>No direct calls to Components should be made, instead use the utilities - getCCService,
	    getCCInstance, getCIInterface, getCIConstant, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h1>Files</h1>
    
    <h2>Internote Utilities</h2>
    <p><code>internote-utils.js</code>, <code>internote-utils-colors.js</code>, <code>internote-utils-coords.js</code>,
       <code>internote-utils-rects.js</code>, <code>internote-utils-web.js</code></p>
    <p>Various utility methods.  The main file contains general methods.  The other files are incorporated into
       the main file, so <strong>they are one object</strong>, <code>internoteUtilities</code> at runtime.</p>
    <p><code>internote-utils-colors.js</code>: Methods for parsing, formatting, and processing colors.</p>
    <p><code>internote-utils-coords.js</code>: Methods for calculating with coordinates as size-2 arrays.</p>
    <p><code>internote-utils-rects.js</code>: Methods for calculating with rectangles.</p>
    <p><code>internote-utils-web.js</code>: Methods for DOM, HTML, XML, CSS and URL manipulation.</p>
    
    <h2>Internote Preferences</h2>
    <p><code>internote-preferences.js</code></p>
    <p>Methods for retrieving preferences.</p>
    
    <h2>Internote Event Dispatcher</h2>
    <p><code>internote-dispatcher.js</code></p>
    <p>This is an event dispatcher used by <code>InternoteStorage</code> and <code>InternoteStorageWatcher</code>.</p>
    
    <h2>Internote Global Singleton</h2>
    <p><code>internote-shared-global.jsm</code></p>
    <p>This is a Javascript code module that allows a singleton for all windows.  It contains
       the storage object, and well as a boolean to indicate total disabling upon initialisation failure,
       which prevents subsequent windows giving unable-to-initialize error messages.</p>
    <h3>Code Notes</h3>
    <p>This is what allows MVC to happen, because calls to it can call back to code registered by
       other windows.</p>
    
    <h2>Internote Storage</h2>
    <p><code>internote-storage.js</code></p>
    <p>This is responsible for in-memory storage of the internotes, note persistence and import/export.</p>
    <p>There is <strong>only one</strong> storage object, shared by all window's UI controllers - it is stored
       in the global singleton.</p>
    <p>It generates events so that the application is Model/View based and so kept up-to-date. It also dispatches
       some preference watching events.</p>
    <p>Each note in storage is represented using the <code>InternoteNote</code> class.</p>
    
    <h2>Internote Storage Watcher</h2>
    <p><code>internote-watcher.js</code></p>
    <p>This maintains a subset of the notes in <code>InternoteStorage</code> that is automatically
       updated based on a filter.  When notes are added to or removed from storage, it determines
       whether this is relevant to the subset, and so whether to generate an add/remove event of its own.
       When notes are modified, it determines whether to pass this event through, or whether this results
	   in notes being added to or removed from the subset, and so whether to generate this sort of event.</p>	   
    <p>It is currently used to determine the notes on a page as well as manager search results.</p>
    <h3>Code Notes</h3>
    <p>The set* methods in storage all check whether the data is actually different, and only
       generate events in that case.  This is important, because with the MVC setup, changes to UI
       lead to events that change storage, and changes to storage lead to events that change the UI.
       This measure therefore prevents infinite recursion.  In theory you could also cause the UI
       to not generate events in this case of being changed by code, but this way is easier.</p>

    <h2>Internote UI Controller</h2>
    <p><code>internote-ui-controller.js</code></p>
    <p>This is the main controller for the application - each window has one.  It ties together the other components,
       performs note animations, drags, watching storage, etc.</p>
    <p>Each note in the user interface is represented with the <code>UINote</code> class, which includes the
       back-end <code>InternoteNote</code> object, and various DOM elements that appear in the UI.</p>
    <h3>Code Notes</h3>
    <p>Both allUINotes and uiNoteLookup are used.  allUINotes allows fast looping and a guarantee of elements
       not being null, but makes delete a little slower and has no order.  uiNoteLookup allows fast lookup by
       number and fast deletion, but is not easy to loop through due to all the nulls that can result.</p>

    <h2>Internote Note UI</h2>
    <p><code>internote-ui-notes.js</code></p>
    
    <p>This is responsible for the UI within each note, including layout, registering callbacks,
       and drawing on canvases.</p>

    <h2>Internote Display UI</h2>
    <p><code>internote-ui-display-popuppane.js, internote-ui-display-separatepopups.js</code></p>
    <p>This is responsible for displaying the notes within the browser.</p>
	<p>Internote2 created absolutely-positioned chrome over the browser, however this no longer
       works in Firefox3.  If a future version of Firefox supports chrome over the viewport again,
	   a new implementation of this could be introduced, and chosen instead by the controller.</p>
	   
	<h3>Code Notes - internote-ui-display-popuppane.js</h3>
	
    <p>This file in Internote3 creates a transparent anchored panel-popup over the viewport,
       within which the notes are displayed.</p>
    <p>Considerable effort must be put into calculating this position and size of this popup,
       in particular if the window goes partially off-screen, as Firefox (at times randomly)
       repositions popups in this situation, and this must be worked around by repositioning
	   and resizing as necessary.</p>
	<p>The <em>outer container</em> is required because we need to use a stack to allow positioning,
	   as you can't position within a panel.</p>
	<p>The <em>inner container</em> is required so that we can easily scroll everything at once,
	   by moving the inner container around in the outer container.</p>
	
    <h2>Internote Balloon UI</h2>
    <p><code>internote-ui-balloon.js</code></p>
    <p>This displays a "balloon" message in the browser to give feedback to the user.</p>

    <h2>Internote Drag UI</h2>
    <p><code>internote-ui-drag.js</code></p>
    <p>This code supports dragging operations, including checking for adequate movement and so
       distinguishing between clicks/drags, supporting ESC-key aborts, calculating offsets,
       cleaning up on failure, and setting up appropriate event handlers.</p>
        
    <h2>Internote Overlay</h2>
    <p><code>internote.xul</code></p>
    <p>This is the main overlay for the Firefox browser.  All code should call methods in the
       UI Controller for that window.</p>
        
    <h2>Internote Manager Dialog</h2>
    <p><code>internote-dlg-manager.xul, internote-dlg-manager.js</code></p>
    <p>This is a dialog that allows management of all notes.</p>

    <h2>Internote Manager Dialog</h2>
    <p><code>internote-dlg-prefs.xul, internote-dlg-prefs.js</code></p>
    <p>This is the preferences dialog.</p>
